**Lunar Attachment for Regolith Sublimation**

## Overview  
The **Lunar Attachment for Regolith Sublimation** (LARS) system is a prototype designed to extract pure water from icy lunar regolith deposits. It utilizes heated drive screws powered by induction coils to penetrate and vaporize the regolith, followed by a steam collection system that condenses the vapor into liquid water for practical use.

This design adheres to the rules and regulations outlined in the 2025 **Australian Rover Challenge**.
