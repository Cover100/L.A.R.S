**Lunar Attachment for Regolith Sublimation**

--- Rendered Image of the project will be inserted here on completion ---

This project is still in development, and setup is subject to change.

## Project Summary
This repository supports the **Lunar Attachment for Regolith Sublimation** (LARS), a prototype designed to extract pure water from icy lunar regolith deposits. The system uses heated drive screws powered by induction coils to penetrate and vaporize the regolith, with a steam collection system that condenses the vapor into liquid water. The LARS system is intended for integration with a lunar rover platform for autonomous operation in challenging lunar environments.


## Key Features:
- **Inductive Heating**: Induction coils heat drive screws, which penetrate and sublimate regolith.
- **Steam Collection System**: Collects the vaporized regolith and condenses it into liquid water.
- **Rover Attachment**: Designed for integration with a rover platform.
- **Modular Components**: The system is designed for scalability and upgrades.

## Project Goal
The goal of LARS is to provide a reliable and efficient method of extracting pure water from the icy lunar regolith, supporting future human missions and robotic exploration.
